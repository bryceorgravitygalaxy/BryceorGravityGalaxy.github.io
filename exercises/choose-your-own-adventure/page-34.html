    <h1>Conclusion!</h1>

        <p>
            After the chase subsided, your friends trusted you to hold on to the 
            emerald for safekeeping, since you're pretty good at this kind of 
            thing. The city was saved, and it's a nice souvenir for this 
            adventure! Maybe we can tell the secret agent guy about this. He'd
            probably be proud of us for it!
        </p>
