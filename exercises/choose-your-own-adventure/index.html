        <p>
            In the evening, you and your team of five other friends 
            get together for what seems like a regular hangout, but little do 
            any of you know, you're all in for a wild adventure. There's info of
            a rare gem that occupies a mysterious base downtown, and a set
            of antagonists are also after it! If it gets into their hands, this
            could spell trouble for the entire city! After learning about
            this, you all head out into the sunset to meet with someone who's
            very skilled in these matters to help lead your team to 
            the emerald!
