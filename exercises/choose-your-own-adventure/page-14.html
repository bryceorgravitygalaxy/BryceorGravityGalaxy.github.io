    <h1>A struggle ensues!</h1>

        <p>
            You were pretty quick on your feet, but so are they, it seems!
        </p>
        <p>
            But it looks like there's not much time to get out of there, as
            the security alarm has gone off! This struggle ends with a draw,
            as the emerald had just gotten cartoonishly shattered from one of
            you tipping it over! Awkwardly, both sides call it a truce and
            make a run for it in opposite directions.
        </p>
