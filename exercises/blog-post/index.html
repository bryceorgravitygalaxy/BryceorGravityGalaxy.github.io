        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I might have talked about this in the past, but I don't think I
                went into as much detail with the impact that various games on
                the Sega Genesis (and not just Sonic of course) had on a lot of
                my story ideas that would follow. It's safe to say those 
                experiences spawned hordes of ideas from childhood, and even 
                now.
