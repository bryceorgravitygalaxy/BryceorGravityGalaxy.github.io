        <br>

        <b>STRAWBERRY CHOCOLATE:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>0.5 ounces freeze-dried strawberries</li>
            <li>12 ounces white chocolate, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <b>STRAWBERRY CHOCOLATE</b>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Blend the freeze-dried strawberries into a 
                fine powder using a food processor or 
                high-speed blender.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Stir the strawberry powder into the melted
                white chocolate until fully smooth and evenly
                combined.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Pour half of the strawberry chocolate onto a 
                parchment-lined tray, spread into a thin layer,
                and refrigerate or freeze until firm.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Set the remaining half of the strawberry
                chocolate aside in a bowl for dipping later.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Once the chilled chocolate has set, chop it
                into small chunks and keep them ready to 
                fold into the cookie dough.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <b>COOKIE DOUGH & BAKING</b>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, whisk together
                the flour, baking soda, salt,
                cornstarch, and matcha powder.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, beat the room 
                temperature butter, white sugar, and
                brown sugar together until light and
                fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla
                extract, and beat again until smooth.
                Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until
                a soft dough forms.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Fold in the chopped strawberry
                chocolate chunks (about 1 to 1 <sup>1/2</sup>
                cups) until evenly combined.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Let the dough rest for 20 minutes
                at room temperature.
            </li>

            <br>
                
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350Â°F 
                and line a baking sheet 
                with parchment paper.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Scoop dough using a large ice cream
                scoop and place 6 on each tray, spaced apart.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Bake for 11 minutes, until the edges are lightly
                golden and the centers are still a bit gooey
                and soft.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Remove from the oven and let the cookies
                cool on the pan for 10 minutes to
                finish setting. 
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Transfer the cookies to a wire rack
                and let them cool completely. Bake the
                second batch of cookies in the meantime.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                If the reserved strawberry chocolate has firmed up, gently 
                re-melt it by microwaving the bowl in 10 to 15 second 
                intervals, stirring well between each, until smooth 
                and melted. Then dip the bottom of each cooled cookie 
                into the strawberry chocolate.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Place them back on a parchment-lined tray
                and pop them in the fridge for 10 minutes
                or until the chocolate is fully set.
            </li>
        </ol>
